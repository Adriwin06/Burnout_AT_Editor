# Burnout Paradise AT Editor

## Installation
You can either download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Adriwin06/Burnout_AT_Editor/releases) but it might be outdated or you can clone the repository and run it with Python.

## Prerequisites

### 1. YAP Tool (Required for Batch Files)
**You must download these files first:**  
üîó [Download YAP from GitHub](https://github.com/burninrubber0/YAP/releases)  
*(Credit to burninrubber0 for the incredible tool, as always)*

**After downloading:**
1. Extract these files where the batch files are:
   - `yap.exe`
   - `Qt6Core.dll`
2. Place the batch files (`extract_vehicles.bat` and `repack_vehicles.bat`) in the **same folder** as YAP

### 2. Python Requirements
```bash
pip install pandas tabulate
```

## Setup Guide

1. **Folder Structure**  
   Create this structure (‚ùó YAP files and batch files must be together):
   ```
   Burnout_AT_Toolkit/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ yap.exe          # From YAP download
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Qt6Core.dll      # From YAP download
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extract_vehicles.bat
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repack_vehicles.bat
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Burnout_AT_Editor/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (other python files)
   ```

2. **Game Files Backup**  
   Always keep a copy of your original `VEHICLES` folder!


## Workflow

### 1. Extract Bundles
#### 1.1 Extract *all* VEHICLES/AT Bundles
```bash
Run extract_vehicles.bat
‚ûú Source: Game's VEHICLES/AT folder
‚ûú Destination: Create new folder (e.g., MyMods/Extracted)
```

#### 1.2 Extract *specific* VEHICLES/AT Bundles
You can use anything you want, like BundleManager or YAP.
With BundleManager, you have to open the AT file in bundle mode and export the header (which is the StreamedDeformationSpecs file).

### 2. Edit Sensors Values from StreamedDeformationSpecs files
```bash
1. Run the tool
2. You can select a specific vehicle or the whole folder that contains extracted files
‚ö†Ô∏è If you select the folder, you will only be able to multiply the values by a factor.
3. Modify values & save
```

### 3. Repack Bundles
#### 3.1 Repack *all* VEHICLES/AT Bundles
```bash
Run repack_vehicles.bat
‚ûú Source: MyMods/Extracted
‚ûú Destination: Create MyMods/Repacked
```
‚ö†Ô∏è It will only work if it is the correct folder structure, so only use it if you used te batch extract to extract the files.

#### 3.2 Repack *specific* VEHICLES/AT Bundles
If you used BundleManager to extract the files, you can just have to reimport the edited header file back into the AT file.

### 4. Install Modified Files
Copy all `.BIN` files from `Repacked` to the game's `VEHICLES` folder

## ‚ùó Important Notes
- Without YAP files, the batch scripts **will not work**
- YAP handles the actual bundle extraction/repacking for the batch extract script
- The editor only modifies values in extracted StreamedDeformationSpecs files
